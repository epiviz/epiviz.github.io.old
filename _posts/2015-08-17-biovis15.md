Our paper detailing the architecture and design of Epiviz is now available on the
[BMC Bioinformatics site](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/16/S11/S4). It is published in a [supplement](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/supplements/16/S11)
 containing a good number of interesting papers from the [Biovis '15](http://www.biovis.net/) conference held as a satellite meeting
 of the [ISMB 2015 conference](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015). We also presented our [Nature Methods](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n9/full/nmeth.3038.html)
 paper on Epiviz in the highlights track at ISMB. Slides for that talk are [available on github](http://hcorrada.github.io/ismb2015/).
