Our first paper describing the Epiviz system was published today in
[Nature Methods](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n9/full/nmeth.3038.html).
From the abstract:

> Visualization is an integral aspect of genomics data
> analysis. Algorithmic-statistical analysis and interactive
> visualization are most effective when used iteratively.
>Epiviz (http://epiviz.cbcb.umd.edu/), a web-based genome browser,
> and the Epivizr Bioconductor package allow interactive, extensible
> and reproducible visualization within a state-of-the-art
> data-analysis platform.

And the editor's blurb:

> Integration of genome visualization with
> Bioconductor-based analysis tools allows rapid
> and interactive analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and epigenomes.
