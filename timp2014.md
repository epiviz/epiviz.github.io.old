## Background

This page contains links to epiviz workspaces containing data from
the following paper:

> W. Timp, H. Corrada Bravo, O.G. McDonald, M. Goggins, C.Umbricht
> M. Zieger, A.P. Feinberg, R.A. Irizarry (2014). *Genome Medicine*,
> *in press*.

## Tissue data

The following sessions contain probe-level methylation values,
smoothed methylation values, and called blocks for normal
and tumor in each tissue type.

[Pancreas](http://epiviz.cbcb.umd.edu/?ws=...)
[Thyroid](http://epiviz.cbcb.umd.edu/?ws=...)

## Blocks in multiple tumors

In this session we include hypo-methylation blocks for all tumor types

## Blocks in tumor development

This session includes hypo-methylation blocks across multiple 
stages of tumor development.
